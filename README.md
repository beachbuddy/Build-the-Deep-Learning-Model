# Build-the-Deep-Learning-Model
Deep Learning Model for AirBnB dataset
Objective

In this milestone, you will learn how to build a deep learning model that has layers defined by the types of the columns that you will use to train the model.
First, you will use the pipeline classes in scikit-learn to create your own classes that perform the steps required to prepare data for training and for scoring (applying the trained model to make predictions on new Airbnb listing).
For each type of column (text, continuous, and categorical), you will define a set of layers using the Keras functional API. Then you will define a function that specifies the Keras callbacks that will be employed during the training process.
Finally, you will define the fit statement that pulls it all together by specifying the input training and validation datasets, the label sets, the callbacks, and other parameters.
